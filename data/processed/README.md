## This folder contains all processed data to be used for analysis.\

I ended up fixing my dataset so that it was sorted by "GICS Sector", "GICS Sub Industry" and "Name". This allowed me to work more effeciently in Tableau. This dataframe can be accessed through the **"daily_gain.csv"** file or the **"daily_gain as excel.xlsx"** file. Tableau did not want me to import the data as a csv file so I was forced to change the file type. 

The **"Adding Columns... Method Chaining.ipynb"** file is where you can test and see the function that I created to import and clean the datasets that were being used. 

**"adding_columns_and_sorting_by_industry.ipynb"** can largely be ignored as it is also contained the the analysis folder under **"EDA and addressing research questions - Look here for Milestone 2-3.ipynb"**.
