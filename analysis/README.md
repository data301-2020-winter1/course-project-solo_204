## Analysis

This folder will have the analysis of **all** processed and raw data and will aim to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. 

Look in the **"Tableau File.twb"** to access my tableau file. 
**"EDA and addressing research questions - Look here for Milestone 2-3.ipynb"** is where the bulk of the work for the project was done. This is where I was able to work with the dataset to get the information that I wanted from it. 

In the scripts folder you can find **"project_functions.ipynb"**. This is the function I created to load my dataset.
