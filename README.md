## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My hope is that I can use data analysis to come up with a conclusion about certain markets beating the average return of the S&P 500 over a multi year period. My hypothesis is that investing in certain industies that will benefit from future macroeconomic events and trends is a better investing strategy than investing broadly the entire S&P 500. I hope to be able to show this through analyzing the data.  

My second research question is whether there is any correlation bewteen the volatility of a stock and its likelyhood to yield aboe average returns. 

My interest in this topic in general comes from my work experience as the Digital Marketing Manager for a private equity company. There I spoke with hundreds of investors that were happy to give out stock tips, though most did not have much to back up there advice with. 

I can imagine using this data to create a user friendly dashboard where the user can compare stock prices of any S&P listed company over a 5 year period.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset that I am using contains the following information for the 500 stocks listed on the S&P 500 as of February 6th, 2018:

- The opening **and** closing price 
- The daily high **and** low prices

The data is available for **all 500 stocks for each trading day** of the 5 year period from February 7th, 2013 to February 6th, 2018. 

The data was originally sourced from The Investor's exchange and was gathered using a script that can be found [here](https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle-code/blob/master/stock_data/getSandP.py.). 

The purpose of collecting the data set is to come up with a meaningful model that can beat the broad market returns by analyzing patterns and trends in stock market prices.

The dataset that I am using was compiled by **Cam Nugent** on kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500?select=all_stocks_5yr.csv).

I also used a secondary data set that can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies). This data set was useful because it allowed me to sort the original dataset into different industries and sub-industries to analyze trends in different areas.
