## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My hope is that I can use data analysis to come up with a conclusion about certain markets beating the average return of the S&P 500 over a multi year period. My hypothesis is that investing in certain industies that will benefit from future macroeconomic events is a better investing strategy than investing in the entire S&P 500 in general.

My interest in this topic in general comes from my work experience as the Digital Marketing Manager for a private equity company. There I spoke with hundreds of investors that were happy to give out stock tips, though most did not have much to back up there advice with. 

I can imagine using this data to create a user friendly dashboard where the user can compare stock prices of any S&P listed company over a 5 year period.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset that I am using contains the the opening and closing price, as well as the daily high and low prices for each trading day of the 5 year period from February 7th, 2013 to February 6th, 2018 of the 500 stocks listed on the S&P 500. The data was originally sourced from The Investor's exchange and was gathered using a script that can be found at (https://github.com/CNuge/kaggle-code/blob/master/stock_data/getSandP.py.) The purpose of collecting the data set is to come up with a meaningful model that can beat the market returns by analyzing patterns and trends in stock market prices. 

The dataset that I am using was compiled by Cam Nugent on kaggle and can be found at (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500?select=all_stocks_5yr.csv)
